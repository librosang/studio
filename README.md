## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18.17 or later)
- A [Firebase Project](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Firebase

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  In your project dashboard, go to **Project Settings** (the gear icon).
3.  Under the "General" tab, scroll down to "Your apps".
4.  Click the **Web** icon (`</>`) to create a new web app.
5.  Give it a nickname and register the app.
6.  You will be shown a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy these keys.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Firebase configuration keys:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

### 5. Configure Firebase Firestore

1.  In the Firebase Console, go to the **Firestore Database** section.
2.  Click **"Create database"**.
3.  Start in **Production mode**.
4.  Choose a location for your database.
5.  Go to the **Rules** tab and paste the following rules. This allows anyone to read/write for development purposes. **Remember to secure this for a real production environment!**

    ```firestore
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if true;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

You can log in with one of the pre-configured test users:
- **Manager**: `manager@test.com`
- **Cashier**: `john@test.com`
